DONE Chapters 1-3
DONE 4 (only the section called "Hosted Git")
DONE 6.1-6.3
7.1-7.8 (skim 7.2 - 7.5, and 7.7)

This material should trump any information you find in the lectures. It is kept in step with the state of Git and will be more accurate if any features change though that is not anticipated.
