*** HTML5 New Section Elements ***

Merging several documents in HTML4 is hard: inclusion of a sub-document in a main document means changing the level of the HTML Headings Element so that the outline is kept. 

This is solved in HTML5 as the newly introduced sectioning elements:

<article>
<section>
<nav>
<aside>

These are always subsections of their nearest ancestor section, regardless of what sections are created by internal headings.
